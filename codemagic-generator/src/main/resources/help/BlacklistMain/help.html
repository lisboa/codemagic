<H4>Introduction</H4>
Before a script is saved in the project, the dbassist checks if some of
rules defined here appear in the script. if true, the script cannot be
saved.
<H4>Wildchars</H4>
The rule can contain the wildchars:
<strong>asterisk</strong>
("*") and
<strong>questions</strong>
("?"). The asterisk matches zero or more characters, while the question
matches zero or one. For example, the rule
<em>'t?mp'</em>
matches
<em>'temp'</em>
and
<em>'tmp'</em>
. The rule
<em>'t*mp'</em>
matches
<em>'temp'</em>
and
<em>'teemp'</em>
, and so on.

<H4>Rules fields</H4>
<p>
	Each rule has an <strong>id</strong> that uniquely identifies it, a <strong>rule</strong>
	that specify the forbidden words, a <strong>message</strong> that show
	a useful message to user, explaining why the words was blocked, a <strong>flag</strong>
	to indicate if the rules is active or not and a list of <strong>environments</strong>
	where this rules should be applied. Some words should be blocked in
	specific environment. For example, in an e-commerce site, possibly the
	word 'test' can not appear in the HLG neither PRD environments.
	Therefore, the blacklist pattern 'test' should apply only for this two
	environments.
