<H4>Introduction</H4>
Use this page to manager the project versions.

<H4>Version fields</H4>
<p>
	Each version has a field <strong>Version</strong> that specify the
	project version. The version can be any text. For example, "1.0.0" or
	"2.0-MyClientName". It is important to use a representative name; a
	flag <strong>Open</strong> to indicate if scripts can be added to this
	version (1) or not (0); a <strong>NumOrder</strong> used to positioning
	the versions in the home page. If a Version A has NumOrder 1 and a
	Version B has NumOrder 2, then B appear before A. The NumOrder value is
	automatically generated when a new version is created. But you can edit
	it to change the appearance order of the versions in the home page. The
	last field is a <strong>Description</strong> , used for informative
	text.
